# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard

# Project Overview
In this project, I will serve as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst at a new investment startup that supports clients in their stock investments. My task will be to extract financial data, such as historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports, from different sources using Python libraries and web scraping techniques. After collecting this information, I will create a dashboard to visualize the data and identify any trends or patterns. The primary stocks I will analyze are Tesla and GameStop.
